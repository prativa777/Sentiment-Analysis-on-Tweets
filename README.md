#Twitter Sentiment Analysis

This project performs sentiment analysis on tweets using machine learning. It classifies tweets into three categories: Positive, Negative, and Irrelevant. The model leverages TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction and Logistic Regression for classification.

The goal of this project is to analyze Twitter data and predict the sentiment of tweets automatically, which can be useful for social media monitoring, brand analysis, and public opinion tracking.
